# Basketball Shot Trainer
**Multidisciplinary Senior Design Project for RIT.** &nbsp; _(P21014)_

The Unified Sports Basketball Shot Trainer analyzes various parameters of a person’s body while shooting a basketball to determine what can be changed to improve the player’s shooting percentage. It analyzes parameters such as arm trajectory, direction of shot, angle of shot, shooting efforts, etc.

The goals of the project are to design a device that can accomplish the task of analyzing the parameters as described above and correlate them to shooting performance based on court position.  The desired end-result is a working portable, battery-operated prototype with non-intrusive body sensors that can be modeled for production. The device is to be used by Unified Sports to improve the shot accuracy of basketball players. There are no concerns for intellectual property.

The aim of this project is to provide an approach to developing players' basketball skills through giving the players tangible feedback on their form and shooting performance. Given that our customer is the Special Olympics Unified Sports league, which gives kids with special needs opportunities to grow, a system that provides feedback for improvement can ultimately help them develop better self-confidence in their abilities.
